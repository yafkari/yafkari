### Hi 👋, I'm Younes

#### A passionate developer from Belgium!

- 👨‍💻 You can find more infos about me on my [personal website](https://yafkari.dev) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/younes-afkari/).
- ✍️ Sometimes I also write (mostly about tech), you can find my articles on [DEV](https://dev.to/yafkari) or on my [personal blog](https://blog.yafkari.dev).
- 💬 Don't hesitate to reach out, who knows if I can help 🙂
- 📫 I prefer getting reached from LinkedIn but do as you wish 😉
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that humanity consumes 400 billion cups of coffee each year? I must admit that I contribute a lot ☕

I'm not very active in open source projects those days but I found this stats funny so here they are:
